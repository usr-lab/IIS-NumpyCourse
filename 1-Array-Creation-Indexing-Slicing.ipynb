    "In numpy everything is centered around the `ndarray` object, which is usually called *array* for simplicity. To quote [the docs](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html), \"\\[a `ndarray`\\] object represents a multidimensional, homogeneous array of fixed-size items\". In many cases, a working analogy to an `ndarray` is a python `list` that has a fixed size and only contains similar items, e.g. all integers or all floats. In N dimensions the analogy is a nested lists of lists where each list on the same level of nesting has the same number of elements. In fact, it is possible to convert between a python list-of-lists and ndarrays. That said, under the hood there are some significant differences between a list or a ndarray and we will look at some of those differences later in this module.\r\n",

    "As you may have noticed, the indexing follows the same method you may be used to from matrix calculus. the first dimension goes along the columns of the matrix, and the second index goes along the rows. Since it is so common to select elements (and ranges) along multiple dimensions, a `ndarray` also supports so-called tuple-indexing. This allows you to omit some of the brackets and instead use a tuple of the same length as the dimensions to access the elements."

The second call takes the new (2-dimensional) array and, again, returns the first two elements along the first dimension. This is exactly the previous array ([[0 1 2 3], [4 5 6 7]]).\r\n",

    "In addition to this, numpy also offers `np.newaxis` as valid index. Its alias is `None` and in fact `(np.newaxis is None) == True`. As the name suggests, it will add a new axis at the desired location analogous to `np.expand_dims`, and is yet another way to add dimensions to an array; similar to using `1` in the shape-tuple of `ndarray.reshape`. This may sound unnecessary at first glance, but will become clear and increadibly useful in section 3 when we talk about array broadcasting.\r\n",

Outside of numpy it doesn't have a lot of uptake; however, inside of numpy, and in particular in tuple-indexing, it can be used to refer to \"everything that hasn't been mentioned explicitly\". This is particularly useful in machine learning while working on batched data. For example, you may have a batch of images that are stacked into a 4 dimensional array in the form of `(batch, height, width, colors)`. With an ellipsis accessing the second image becomes `image_batch[1, ...]`.\r\n",
