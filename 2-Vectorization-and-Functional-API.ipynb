    "\r\n",
    "The goal of this section is to introduce you to some of the functions in the numpy library and to introduce the concept of vectorization, which allows you to write performant and clean code. To kick off this section, here is an example that motivates why you want to learn about vectorization. Below you can find three versions of a function that adds a number to each element in a 2d array (matrix). The first uses a traditional list syntax, the second does the list-style additions on a `ndarray`, and the third one uses vectorization and the numpy API. Each addition is executed 100 times\r\n",

    "**Note**: This example takes about 30s to complete on my computer. You can run it, and study the code while it executes."

    "On my machine the list version takes about 0.5 ms to process a (1000, 1000) array. If we only need to do it a few times this is certainly something we can live with; on the other hand, if it happens along the critical path (the sequence of code that takes the most time in our current program) then we might wish to optimize it. This is where numpy shines, which - again on my machine - is a whooping 90x faster. Perhaps even more surprisingly, numpy's version of `array + number` looks very similar to the above loops if you peak under the hood.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "So why is numpy so much faster? The short answer is *optimization*. The not so short and very technical answer is that there are multiple factors contributing to this. The first is that numpy calls a C function under the hood. C code tends to be faster than python code, because (a) C code can do compile-time optimizations, and (b) C code doesn't have to check for exceptions after each step. The next speed boost comes from a different memory layout. A python list is a sequence of objects that can - essentially - live in different locations of your RAM, whereas numpy arrays are guaranteed to occupy a single continous block of memory. Instead of checking where the next element is located we can directly go to the neighbouring memory block, which - again - makes our code much faster. Thirdly, because of this difference in memory layout we can use something called SIMD (sometimes called vectorization extension), a special ability of many modern CPUs to process a block of numbers in one step. Finally, being in C allows us to side-step the python GIL and use threads that actually run in parallel. While numpy itself doesn't do multi-threadding, some of the libraries that it builds on (MKL/OpenBLAS) might.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The second observation we can make is that manually adding to a `ndarray` is about 4x slower than the list-of-list version. This highlights a second important aspect of the numpy API. Numpy is implemented in C, and there is a constant overhead associated with calling a C function from python. This overhead is so small, that we don't have to worry about it if we do few calls. However, if we call a numpy function 1 million times (1000 * 1000) in a loop this overhead becomes painfully noticable."

    "## Vectorization\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "A typical description of vectorization is *to remove the for loops from your code*. However, a more accurate description of vectorization is *replace parts of your code with function calls from a highly-optimized library*. It is about letting your computer know that you want to perform a certain operation repeatedly on every element in some structure, and that this operation is pure in the sense that it will have no side-effects on other variables in our code. Most languages offer libraries tailored to this purpose. Within such a library you usually find an array of functions that correspond to primitive operations (plus, minus, multiply, divide, modulo, sin, cos, ...). Each function typically takes in one or more special objects, e.g. `ndarray`s, and performs the desired operation for you on every element in the structure and returns the result. From your (a users) perspective, however, it really is a game of *which piece of my program can I replace with a function call from this library* and - usually - every for loop that does numerical processing is a good place to start.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Numpy makes this job particularily easy, because it has a symbiotic and insanley deep relationship with the language itself. Some parts of the python language, e.g. Ellipsis (...), exist in python because the numpy community asked for it). As a result, most basic python operators (`+`, `-`, `%`, ...) are overloaded for numpy arrays and they will automatically call the optimized function for you without you having to worry about it explicitly. Most other functions are available in numpy's primary namespace, e.g., `np.sin`, `np.dot`, `np.sum`, and many more. These are called `ufunc`s which stands for universal functions.\r\n",

Above, we were mainly looking at replacing operations on individual elements. However, nothing stops us from extending this notion to operations on individual rows, individual columns, or more generally, individual axes of an array. For example, we might wish to sum up every row in a matrix. We may also wish to do this for groups of two or more arrays, e.g., we might wish to compute a matrix-vector multiplication (`@`) or we may wish to compute the dot product of two (or more vectors).
